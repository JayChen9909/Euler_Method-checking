# Euler_Method-checking  
Code in this 'Euler_Method checking.ipynb' file can directly run on Jupyter Notebook with Julia core, which calculates the Euler Integration for the Neural ODE.  
And the comparison between Euler Integration and other method such as Tsit5 is shown to illustrate the time accuracy.  
(Graphs are not shown when you check it on Github repository, it would work normally when run in Jupyter Notebook)
